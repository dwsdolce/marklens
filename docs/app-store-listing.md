## Description (4000 max)

```
Marklens is a fast, native Markdown viewer for macOS, iPadOS, and iPhone.
Open any .md file with a click and see it rendered immediately — beautiful
typography, light and dark themes, syntax-highlighted code, and Mermaid
diagrams. No editor, no library, no friction.

HIGHLIGHTS

• Instant render — every .md opens in a clean, focused window
• 30+ language syntax highlighting via highlight.js, bundled offline
• Mermaid 11 diagrams — flowcharts, sequence, state, xy-charts and more
• GitHub-Flavored Markdown — tables, task lists, footnotes, strikethrough
• Light and dark theme matching the system appearance
• Quick Look on macOS — press Space on any .md in Finder for a rendered preview
• Export to PDF on every platform
• Pinch-to-zoom on iPadOS and iPhone, ⌘+ / ⌘− / ⌘0 on macOS
• Open files via drag-and-drop, the Share Sheet, or the Files app

MADE FOR READING

Marklens doesn't try to be a notes app or a knowledge base. It opens a
file, renders it perfectly, and gets out of the way. If you write Markdown
in another tool — VS Code, Obsidian, GitHub, your favorite text editor —
Marklens is the viewer you reach for to look at the result.

PRIVATE BY DESIGN

Marklens collects nothing. No analytics, no telemetry, no crash reports,
no network requests. Every rendering asset — Mermaid, highlight.js,
fonts — ships inside the app. Read the full privacy policy at
https://donald-jackson.github.io/marklens/privacy/

OPEN SOURCE

Marklens is MIT-licensed and developed in the open. Source, issues, and
contribution guide live at https://github.com/donald-jackson/marklens.

## Review notes (App Review Information)

Paste this in the **Notes** field under App Review Information. It pre-empts the one question a reviewer is likely to ask:

```
Marklens declares the com.apple.security.network.client entitlement only
because Apple's WKWebView framework requires it to initialise its
WebContent XPC process when rendering bundled local HTML. The app makes
no network requests and contains no networking code. All assets used to
render Markdown (Mermaid, highlight.js, fonts, themes) are bundled inside
the app and loaded from the main bundle.

Marklens collects no user data. There are no analytics, no telemetry, no
crash reporting frameworks, and no third-party SDKs. PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy
manifests are included for both the app and the Quick Look extension and
declare the same — no tracking, no data collection.

The Quick Look extension renders the same HTML the app produces, using
the same MarklensCore library. It runs sandboxed and inherits the same
empty data-collection profile.

No demo account required (the app has no login).

## Screenshots

Required by App Store Connect:

| Platform | Required size | Min count |
|---|---|---|
| iPhone 6.9" (17 Pro / Max) | 1320 × 2868 | 1 |
| iPad 13" | 2064 × 2752 | 1 |
| Mac | 1280 × 800 (up to 2880 × 1800) | 1 |

Recommended: 3–5 screenshots per platform showing a mix of:
1. Welcome / launch screen
2. A rendered document (try `Samples/welcome.md`)
3. Code-highlighting showcase (`Samples/code-showcase.md`)
4. Mermaid diagrams (`Samples/diagrams.md`)
5. The app icon nicely positioned (Mac only — Quick Look preview in Finder is a great hero shot)

Use `scripts/screenshot.sh` (see repo root) to auto-capture from booted simulators.
